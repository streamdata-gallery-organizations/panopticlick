description: When you visit a website, online trackers and the site itself may be
  able to identify you &ndash; even if you&rsquo;ve installed software to protect
  yourself. It&rsquo;s possible to configure your browser to thwart tracking, but
  many people don&rsquo;t know how. Panopticlick will analyze how well your browser
  and add-ons protect you against online tracking techniques. We&rsquo;ll also see
  if your system is uniquely configured&mdash;and thus identifiable&mdash;even if
  you are using privacy-protective software.
